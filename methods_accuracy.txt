Testing k-mer and reference based SNP concordance
A dataset of 1000 real world Salmonella Typhi samples was assembled using Enterobase to identify genomes which were in silico serotyped with SISTR as Typhi (D:d:-). This initial set of genomes were then filtered to include samples with >=40X coverage, genome size from 4.4Mb to 5.5Mb, and to maximize diversity of samples we de-duplicated the dataset based on the HC20 cluster identity from Enterobase. The metadata and list of public data used for the benchmarking is available in the supplemental material (Supplemental Table – Typhi Real World Dataset). Using the existing Typhi SNP genotyping scheme from (X) representing 68 positions in the Typhi genome and we compared the genotyping results from BioHansel and a popular reference mapping SNP calling program SNIPPY.  We examined three levels of SNP coverage: 3, 6, and 8 reads and how that influenced the detected base by each program for this dataset ranging from 40X to 750X estimated coverage. Each position could be one of three states: ref, alt, or no call and we pair-wise compared each sample’s reported genotype between BioHansel and SNIPPY across the three coverage thresholds. Python scripts were designed to extract the detected base for each position and tool can be found here: https://github.com/jrober84/bio_hansel_benchmarking.
